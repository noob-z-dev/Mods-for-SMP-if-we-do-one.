2: Get Curseforge and make it version 1.16.5. To download watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7pCMg5lOEY (This is optional, I think.)

3: Make a new file in %appdata%\.minecraft called "mods", This will be your mods folder.

4: Add Jar Files into the new folder. (Don't put the installer (fabric installer)  in the mods though.)

5: Open the Fabric Installation file and follow the instructions the application give you. (If you see "Open with" or something related, you might not have java installed. Refer back to #1's link.)

6: Switch to Fabric Loader 1.16.5 Installation in the Minecraft Java Launcher and then click the play button.

That's all.
